Cows and Bulls is a guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number. This number has exactly four digits between 0 and 9 with no duplicates.

You will be asked to enter a four-digit number. If a digit is in the generated number and is in the correct position, the digit is a "bull". If it is in a different position, it is a "cow". The numbers of cows and bulls will be shown to you. You win once you have correctly guessed the number.
